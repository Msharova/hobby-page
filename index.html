      Hiking is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or footpaths in the
      countryside. Walking for pleasure developed in Europe during the
      eighteenth century. Religious pilgrimages have existed much longer but
      they involve walking long distances for a spiritual purpose associated
      with specific religions. "Hiking" is the preferred term in Canada and the
      United States; the term "walking" is used in these regions for shorter,
      particularly urban walks. In the United Kingdom and the Republic of
      Ireland, the word "walking" describes all forms of walking, whether it is
      a walk in the park or backpacking in the Alps. The word hiking is also
      often used in the UK, along with rambling , hillwalking, and fell walking
      (a term mostly used for hillwalking in northern England). The term
      bushwalking is endemic to Australia, having been adopted by the Sydney
      Bush Walkers club in 1927. In New Zealand a long, vigorous walk or hike is
      called tramping. It is a popular activity with numerous hiking
      organizations worldwide, and studies suggest that all forms of walking
      have health benefits.
